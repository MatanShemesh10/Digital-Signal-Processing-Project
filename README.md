# Digital-Signal-Processing-Project

In the Introduction to Digital Signal Processing course, we carried out two different projects focusing on digital signal processing using MATLAB, machine learning, and deep learning with Python.

**Achievements and Project Goals:**
• To develop and analyze sampling and reconstruction systems.
• To analyze and design filters in the time domain, frequency domain, and Z-domain.
• To perform basic spectral analysis.
• To implement a fast algorithm for convolution and discrete Fourier transform.
• To identify and formulate relevant problems related to data analysis, such as machine learning problems (regression and classification).
• To utilize popular open-source libraries in the industry for training classification using gradient descent algorithms, including detailed performance evaluation and model selection.
• To use pre-trained models for data analysis, both for training and future data.
